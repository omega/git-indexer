h1. git-indexer

This isn't really an indexer, so it is lying a bit right of the bat. What it really
does is look for JIRA issue IDs in commit messages in git, and then looks on github
for comments on those commits, storing it all on the correct issue in a mongodb

There is a second half of this, that is a jira plugin to display this as an issue
panel, but that is not quite ready for prime time, but it is comming

h1. installation

# Install mongodb
# Install node.js
# Use npm to install required node modules:
<code>
npm chain-gang colors  confu  mongoose  spore
</code>
# Create a data directory in the root directory


h1. config

We look for a config.json alongside the app, containing the following:

<pre><code>
{
    "org": "my_organization", // Your organization, we don't support single users atm
    "web": {
        "port": 8091 // Port you want the web server to listen to
    },
    "paths": {
        "repo_base": "data/" // Where to store the cloned repos
    },
    "github_auth": {
        "user": myname // github user name
        "pw"  : topsecret // github password
    },
    "git_auth": {  // pointless duplication
        "user": myname // github user name
        "pw"  : topsecret // github password
    },
    "mongo": "mongodb://localhost/jira" // The mongodb to connect to
    "repos": {
        "inc": [
            "my-good-repo",
            "my-other-repo",
            "some-weird-code",
            ]
    },
}
</code></pre>

h1. what is what?

You run @node reader.js@ to get it all running. It will clone and index all your repos for you.
@node webserver.js@ starts the web server.

It serves the following URLs:
@http://localhost:8091/repos@ List of repos defined in the config file
@http://localhost:8091/issue/XXX-111@ Commits tagged with issue XXX-111
@http://localhost:8091/issues_for_repo/my-repo@ Issues tagged in commits to repo my-repo
